// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to place controls in a LayoutControl's tabbed group header
// 
// By default, it is not possible to place any control within a tabbed group
// header, because the LayoutControl's layout can be widely customized (groups can
// be moved and hidden, their direction can be changed). However, you can emulate
// controls by custom drawing them. This example demonstrates how to draw a
// CheckBox and ProgressBar in headers.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:
